                <p>The first Formula One World Championship season was in 1950, with the inaugural race held at
                    Silverstone in the United Kingdom.
                    While the concept of a Formula One championship was discussed in the late 1930s, it was delayed due
                    to World War II. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) established the standardized
                    regulations in 1946, and the first championship race was held in 1950. </p>

            <p>A Formula 1 car is a highly advanced, single-seat, open-wheel racing vehicle designed for speed and
                agility. It features a lightweight carbon fiber chassis, a turbocharged V6 engine, and sophisticated
                aerodynamics, including front and rear wings. These cars are engineered for maximum downforce and
                cornering speed, with a minimum weight of 798 kg including the driver. </p>

            <p style="text-align:left ;">Formula 1 drivers who have won 7 World Championship titles: Michael Schumacher
                and Lewis Hamilton.Lewis Hamilton is a seven-time Formula 1 World Champion. He won his titles in the
                years 2008, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. His seventh title, won in 2020, equaled Michael
                Schumacher's record for the most F1 World Championships. Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton (born 7
                January 1985) is a British racing driver who competes in Formula One for Ferrari. Hamilton has won a
                joint-record seven Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles—tied with Michael Schumacher—and holds
                the records for most wins (105), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (202), among others Born and
                raised in Stevenage, Hamilton began his career in karting aged six, winning several national titles and
                attracting the attention of Ron Dennis, who signed him to the McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme in
                1998. After winning the direct-drive Karting World Cup and European Championship in 2000, Hamilton
                progressed to junior formulae, where his successes included winning the Formula 3 Euro Series and the
                GP2 Series. He subsequently signed for McLaren in 2007, becoming the first black driver to compete in
                Formula One at the Australian Grand Prix</p>

            <h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
            <p>Formula 1 teams operate under a comprehensive set of rules and regulations set by the FIA, governing
                everything from car design and performance to race procedures and sporting conduct. These rules are
                designed to ensure safety, fairness, and sporting competition, while also promoting innovation and
                sustainability.</p>
            <h2>1.Car regulations</h2>
            <h3>Technical Regulations</h3>
            <p>These dictate the design and construction of the cars, including
                aerodynamics, chassis, engine, suspension, and more. The aim is to limit performance advantages and
                promote close racing.The minimum weight for a Formula 1 car is 798 kg (1,759 lb), including the driver
                and fitted with dry-weather tires but without fuel. The cars also have strict dimensional regulations,
                with a maximum length of 5.63 m (18.5 ft), width of 2 m (6 ft 7 in), and height of 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in).
                Aerodynamics play a crucial role, with teams using advanced technologies like Computational Fluid
                Dynamics (CFD) to optimize airflow and generate downforce, which helps the car stick to the track. </p>
            <h3>Sporting Regulations</h3>
            <p>These rules govern the race weekend format, qualifying procedures, starting procedures, pit stops, and
                track limits. A "three strikes" system is often used for track limits violations during race sessions,
                where exceeding track limits results in a deleted lap time and a strike. </p>
            <h3>Tyre Usage</h3>
            <p style="text-align:left;">teams are allotted a specific number of tire sets for each race weekend, with
                rules dictating how they can be used during practice, qualifying, and the race itself. Teams are
                provided with 13 sets of dry weather tires, 4 sets of intermediate tires, and 3 sets of wet weather
                tires. Drivers must use at least two different dry tire compounds during a dry race, and those who reach
                Q3 must start the race on the tires they used for their fastest Q2 lap.
                Dry Weather Tires: Each driver gets 13 sets of dry tires (also known as slick tires).
                Intermediate Tires: 4 sets are provided for damp conditions where the track is not fully wet.
                Wet Weather Tires: 3 sets are available for heavy rain.
                Compound Choices: Within the 13 sets of dry tires, teams have flexibility in choosing which compounds
                (soft, medium, hard) to bring to the race weekend, based on Pirelli's selection for that specific track.
                Q3 Set: One extra set of the softest compound is reserved for drivers who make it to Q3 in qualifying.
                Tire Usage Rules:
                Minimum Compounds: In a dry race, drivers must use at least two different slick compounds.
                Q2 Lap Time: Drivers who reach Q3 must start the race on the tires they used for their fastest lap in
                Q2.
                Mandatory Returns: Teams must return specific sets of tires to Pirelli after certain practice sessions.
                Unique Identifiers: Each tire is marked with a unique identifier for tracking and scrutiny.
                End of Weekend: All tires, used or unused, must be returned to Pirelli at the end of the race weekend.
            </p>
            <h3>Weight and Dimensions</h3>
            <p style="text-align:center;">The minimum weight for an F1 car, including the driver but without fuel, is
                798 kg. The car's width is capped at 200 cm, and height at 200 cm. While there isn't a maximum length,
                other rules indirectly limit the size, resulting in similar dimensions across all carsThe car must have
                four wheels, with the front two steered and the rear two driven. </p>

                <h2>Driving Rules</h2>
                <p>F1 driving rules encompass a wide range of regulations designed to ensure fair competition, driver
                    safety, and the overall integrity of the sport. These rules govern everything from track limits and
                    overtaking maneuvers to car specifications and safety procedures. Essentially, drivers must adhere
                    to a complex set of guidelines to avoid penalties and maintain their position in the race.</p>

                <p>drivers adhere to a comprehensive set of rules, including those related to driving, car performance,
                    and race procedures. Key driving rules involve maintaining track limits, avoiding contact with other
                    cars, and respecting the signals and instructions from race officials. Additionally, drivers must
                    adhere to specific regulations regarding the use of the Drag Reduction System (DRS), tyre usage, and
                    pit stop procedures. </p>

                <p>the wooden plank (or skid block) under the car is crucial for enforcing ride height
                    regulations and preventing excessive downforce. If a car's plank wears down beyond a specified limit
                    during a race (usually 1mm of wear), the team faces disqualification. This happened to Lewis
                    Hamilton and Charles Leclerc at the 2023 United States Grand Prix, and previously to Michael
                    Schumacher at the 1994 Belgian Grand Prix. The plank's purpose is to ensure cars don't run too low,
                    which would create dangerous levels of downforce and potentially cause the car to bottom out or
                    "porpoise".</p>
